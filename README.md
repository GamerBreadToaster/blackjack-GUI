# Blackjack
Welcome to my blackjack project! To start, download the code.

After you have to download some modules. You can do this by opening a terminal in this folder and pasting this command.

windows:
`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

linux and mac:
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then open blackjack_GUI.py to have some fun!
